{"id":9411,"site_id":6,"user_id":20,"body":"# Publish from Collected Notes to GitHub Pages\n\nMy blog is a statically generated Jekyll site hosted on GitHub pages.\n\nWhile I do use Collected Notes to post some short things, I havenâ€™t migrated my blog there since it will break all my past permalinks. However, I do love the simplicity to both write and publish quickly from any device that Collected Notes gives me.\n\nIn order to keep the best of both worlds, I created a small GitHub Action, that I can trigger from my phone using Shortcuts, that will quickly import a note in Collected to a post in GitHub Pages.\n\nYou can check the code [here](https://github.com/pbendersky/pbendersky.github.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/import-from-cn.yml)\n\nThe important part is this shell script:\n\n```bash\n\ncurl --location ${{ github.event.client_payload.url }}.json \u003e note.json\ndate_prefix=`date +%Y-%m-%d`\nmarkdown_name=${date_prefix}-`jq -r '.path' note.json`.markdown\ntitle=`jq -r '.title' note.json`\npost_path=$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/_posts/${markdown_name}\ncat \u003c\u003cEOF \u003e ${post_path}  \n---\ntitle: ${title}\ndate: `date --iso-8601=seconds`\n---\n`jq -r '.body' note.json`\nEOF\n```\n\nIn order to run it, you have to:\n\n1. Create the GitHub Action.\n2. Create a Personal Token in GitHub.\n3. Import [this Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ddd6c18c623f4bda8fcb4ef59f184fe7) (or create your own!)\n4. From your iOS device, share a note in CN and choose the Shortcut.\n5.
