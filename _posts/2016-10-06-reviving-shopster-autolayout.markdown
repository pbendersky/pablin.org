I'm trying to revive Shopster, an app we launched 2013, and I'm writing througout the process. If this is the first post you see, you can start [here](http://pablin.org/2016/09/23/reviving-shopster-worth-it/).

Shopster uses Storyboards. I like them and can say I was an early adopter of them. Now with Storyboard references, I think they are even better and simpler to use.

As I wrote before, our app only supported 4 inch phones (iPhone 5 / 5s / 5c / SE), and was not written using Auto Layout. So my next step is to enable AutoLayout and fix the layout of every screen.

Luckily, the app has about 8 screens total, so that should not be too hard.
