Apple has released [ResearchKit as open source on GitHub](http://researchkit.github.io/index.html). This is the right call, and I'm glad to [have been proved wrong](http://pablin.org/2015/03/10/raw-thoughts-on-apples-spring-forward-event/).

Let's hope its development is in the open as well, so it can grow into a tool anyone can use and benefit from.
