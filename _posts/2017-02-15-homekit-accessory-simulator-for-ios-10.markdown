If you are developing for HomeKit, you will probably want to use the [HomeKit Accessory Simulator](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/HomeKitDeveloperGuide/EnablingHomeKit/EnablingHomeKit.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015050-CH2-SW3).

To download it, we are instructed to search for "Hardware IO Tools for Xcode". However, in Xcode 8, this package changed its name to "Additional Tools for Xcode". If you are looking for the latest supported HomeKit accesory types, search for the latest version.
