A nice thing about reviving a project, is that I get to choose the target platform again. In this case, I don't see a reason not to make it iOS 10 only: up until iOS 9, the app worked (even if it was not optimized for), so users of iOS 9 can remain on the old version.

This gives me the chance of remove a lot of old stuff that I had laying around, mainly to support older OS versions.
