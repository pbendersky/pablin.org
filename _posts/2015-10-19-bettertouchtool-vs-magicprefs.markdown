Ever since I got a Magic Mouse, I've been using [MagicPrefs] to configure a middle click on it (basically, to open Safari tabs in the background).

With [El Capitan], Apple added a feature to shake the mouse to find the pointer. Even though I don't need it too much, I was bummed to discover that this feature failes with MagicPrefs, so it gave me a good excuse to try [BetterTouchTool] instead, which works with this feature.

Overall, I like MagicPrefs better (it's a System Preferences pane instead of only an app, and the settings are less cluttered), but I'll be sticking to BetterTouchTool for now.
