This is the blog I've been intending two start for at least two years now. It took me a lot of courage to
get started, and it's taking me more time than I expected to put in writing the ideas I have on my mind.

## Why in English?
Having been born and living in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I feel I need to address this first.
I have to main reasons:

1. Most of my reading (and [listening](http://5by5.tv)) is in English. I'd like to think some of the people I read might at some point be interested I what I write. For that, I need to remove any language barrier.
2. It's an amazing practice for me. It's hard to be a developer without having to read English (and if you want to be a good one you need to be able to [write](http://stackoverflow.com) in English as well).

## My modest goals
I hope I can be consistent with this endeavor. I think it will help me grow profesionally,
and as a writer.

I look forward to the experience and to get feedback from anyone coming across to this site.
