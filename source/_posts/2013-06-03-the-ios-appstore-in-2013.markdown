On March 28th 2013, after several months of development we launched Shopster, our groceries list app.
On this post I'd like to cover what we did in anticipation to the launch, how it correlated to sales, and a glimpse n our future plans. I think it paints a good picture of the state of the iOS AppStore in 2013.

## About Shopster

In case you don't know it, here's what Shopster looks like.
It's a simple groceries list app with a twist: it automatically learns the location where you check an item as purchased, sit it can later use it to trigger a location geo-fenced reminder.

## Pre-launch
We submitted the app to Apple with time to spare, and set a release date well in advance. This gives you time to pitch your app to tech writers for reviews while having promo codes available, as well as some cushion time should you need to submit an urgent fix (we did, and it was great to see it approved before launch).

We started pitching well known blogs based on our preferences and by checking their reviews of competing apps. For each blog we tried to find -when possible- he specific person to write to, instead of just sending a generic email.

We also booked an ad with [The Syndicate] for the week after our launch. We see this ad as kind of a meta ad: their network covers sites that are followed not only by our target audience, which is very broad, but also by lots of other bloggers who review apps. My thinking here was that it could help us boost awareness of the app and have more reviews.

## Launch day
The launch date arrived, and the app showed up in the app stores. It was a national holiday Argentina, so I was out of the office playing with my kids, while frantically checking email and reloading RSS feeds and Twitter looking for mentions of our app.  
On launch date the app was mentioned by [The Loop], [TUAW] and [GigaOm]. Our road to fame and money had begun, or so we thought until the next morning.

## First week of sales
I can't say the first day sales were a disappointment, as I was not sure what to expect, since [our][NineGaps] [previous][RuneTrails] [apps][AlienCab] did not have the coverage Shopster had. We were surprised to see the app had only sold about 200 units. Here's a graphic of our sales (in units) throughout the first week in the AppStore:

What's interesting for me here is to see how these sales correlate withe AppStore rankings. With about 200 sales a day, our app was banked in the top 500 top grossing apps.

## first month
Dring the first month of life of the app, we continued too gain awareness of the app. Shopster got reviewed by Gzmodo (and chosen app of the week), and finally, on ... It was picked by Apple as new and noteworthy. At the point we thought sales would skyrocket. We even got a tweet from @appstore:

## Analysis
It's still hard for me to understand what makes an app a hit and whatn makes it fail, so ill share my hypothesis here of what happened with Shopster:
- we downplayed the ability to share lists. We knew it was important and the competition had it, but we decided to leave it out of 1.0.min retrospect it was probably a mistake.
- Geo-fencing is probably only useful for a subset of potential customers. Our marquee feature, is having the app learn th evocations where you buy stuff, is probably most useful for metropolitan users that commute to work and walk a little. For these users, the feature can prove a life saver[]. For the rest, is probably not as useful.
- Users invested in other apps are not eager to switch. It's hard to steal a loyal customer unless its using a clearly worse alternative. It he's using one of our better competitors, the probably have nested a lot of time and effort into making these apps suite their needs and won't look for alternatives. This is a clear contrast to more technical users. If you create a rss reader, more tech savvy users might test several of them and be eager to switch temporarily.
