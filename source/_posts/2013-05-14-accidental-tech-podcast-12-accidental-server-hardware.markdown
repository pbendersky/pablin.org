If you read [my post](http://pablin.org/2013/05/06/apples-tick-tock-strategy/) on Apple's Tick-Tock strategy,
don't miss the episode of ATP where Casey Liss does a dramatic reading of part of it, and John mainly
disagrees with my point.  
After listening, he brings up a good point: iOS is not mature enough to be at a "Snow Leopard" level of
refinements, so each version comes packed with new features. I still stand by my previous post though, and think iOS 4 and iOS 6 refined a lot of groundbreaking features in iOS 3 and iOS 5.

[ATP](http://atp.fm) is one of my favorite podcasts. If you are not listening to it regularly, give it a try.
