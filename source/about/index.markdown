I'm Pablo Bendersky, a software developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

In 2002 I married my awesome wife, Karina.

In 2004 I co-founded Quadion Technologies, a software development shop.

On 2011 we became parents of twins, and it's been an amazing ride ever since.

My current interests, and the main driver for this blog, are development in general and iOS and Apple stuff
in particular.
